                                been conducting a trial program called
                                Flight Forward, using autonomous drone
                                deliveries of critical medical samples
                                including blood or tissue between two
                                branches of a hospital in Raleigh, N.C.,
                                located 150 yards apart. A fleet-footed
                                runner could cover the distance almost as
                                fast as the drones, but as a
                                proof-of-concept program, it succeeded,
                                and in October the FAA granted the company
                                approval to expand to 20 hospitals around
                                the U.S. over the next two years.
                                “We expect UPS Flight Forward to one day
                                be a very significant part of our company,”
                                says UPS CEO David Abney of the service,
                                which will deliver urine, blood and tissue
                                samples, and medical essentials like drugs
                                and transfusable blood. UPS is not alone
                                in pioneering air deliveries. Wing,
                                a division of Google’s parent company
                                Alphabet, received similar, but more
                                limited, FAA approval to make deliveries
                                for both Walgreens and FedEx.
                                And in Ghana and Rwanda,
                                drones operated by Silicon Valley
                                start up Zipline are already delivering
                                medical supplies to rural villages

                                threatens to hamper the era of personalized
                                medicine: people of Caucasian descent are
                                a minority in the global population yet
                                make up nearly 80% of the subjects in
                                human-genome research, creating blind
                                spots in drug research. DR. Abasi Ene
                                obang, 34, founded 54gene to change that.
                                Named for Africa’s 54 countries, the
                                Nigeria-based start up is sourcing genetic
                                material from volunteers across the
                                continent, to make drug research and
                                development more equitable. 54gene is
                                conscious of the ugly history of colonial
                                exploitation in Africa. If companies are
                                going to profit by developing marketable
                                drugs based on the DNA of African people,
                                Africa should benefit: so, when partnering
                                with companies, 54gene prioritizes those
                                that commit to including African countries
                                in marketing plans for any resulting drugs.
                                “If we are part of the pathway for drug
                                creation, then maybe we can also become
                                part of the pathway to get these drugs
                                into Africa,” Ene-Obong says

                                his approach to medical research. The Parker
                                Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy,
                                established by Napster co-founder and
                                former Facebook president Sean Parker, is
                                a network of top institutions including
                                Memorial Sloan Kettering, Stanford, the
                                MD Anderson Cancer Center and more. Its
                                goal is to identify and remove obstacles
                                to innovation in traditional research. For
                                example, all of the participating institutes
                                have agreed to accept an approval
                                decision by any of their respective
                                Institutional Review Boards, which “allows
                                us to get major clinical trials off the
                                ground in weeks rather than years,” says
                                Parker, and at lower costs. Perhaps most
                                important, Parker wants to infuse the
                                project with his market sensibility: “We
                                follow the discoveries coming from our
                                researchers and then put our money behind
                                commercializing them,” he says, either
                                by licensing a product or spinning it
                                out into a company. Since its founding
                                in 2016, the institute has brought 11
                                projects to clinical trials and
                                supported some 2,000 research papers.</p>

                                Symptoms of lung cancer usually don’t appear
                                until its later stages, when it’s difficult
                                to treat. Early screening of high-risk
                                populations with CT scans can reduce the
                                risk of dying, but it comes with risks of
                                its own. The U.S. National Institutes of
                                Health found that 2.5% of patients who
                                received CT scans later endured needlessly
                                invasive treatments—-sometimes with fatal
                                results—after radiologists erroneously
                                diagnosed false positives. Shravya Shetty
                                believes artificial intelligence may be
                                the solution. Shetty is the research lead
                                of a Google Health team that in the past
                                two years built an AI system that
                                outperforms human radiologists in
                                diagnosing lung cancer. After being
                                trained on more than 45,000 patient
                                CT scans, Google’s algorithm detected
                                5% more cancer cases and had 11% fewer
                                false positives than a control group of
                                six human radiologists. The early results
                                are promising, but “there’s a pretty big
                                gap between where things are and where they
                                could be,” says Shetty. “It’s that potential
                                impact that keeps me going.”<i>— Corinne Purtill.</i></p>

                                necessary to diagnose blocked or narrowed
                                arteries. Doctors must then choose the best

                                angioplasty and stenting. Charles Taylor,

                                and zoomed into, so doctors can simulate
                                various approaches on screens. In some
                                cases, it can help avoid invasive procedures
